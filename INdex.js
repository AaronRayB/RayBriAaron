                        <p>One summer, my father and I took on a personal project together: expanding our neighbor's driveway by moving their fence further into their backyard. This created additional space, allowing residents to exit the basement safely without any car blocking the sidewalk.</p>

                        <p>Shell Canada hired me and my best friend, Darren, whose father runs a plumbing business, to drain sewage pipes at a local gas station and fix any broken pipes in the toilet stalls. We used equipment such as drain snakes, sewer rods, vacuum trucks, and chemical cleaners.</p>

                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> My name is Aaron Ray Brittannia, and I am a second-year student at Ontario Tech University, majoring in Networking and IT Security. I come from a diverse background, with roots in both India and Portugal. As the youngest in my family, I have an older sister who is 23 years old.</p>
                    <p> In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and staying active by going to the gym, where I focus on building strength. As an avid gamer, I currently love playing Overwatch 2 and Warframe. Growing up, the Ratchet series and the Destiny franchise were some of my favorite games. I also have a passion for baking, particularly sweet desserts. One of my specialties is French maple toast, which reflects my undeniable sweet tooth.</p>
